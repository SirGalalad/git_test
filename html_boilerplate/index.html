        <p>Here is another, <em>ANOTHA ONE</em> one so that we can <strong><em>Seeeeee</em></strong> how it would like to work.</p>
        <!-- That use of strong and em for one word is experimentation -->
        <!-- Let's start a list practice here, where you can have an "Unordered list" which uses the tag: "<ul>" followed by "list item": <li> for each bullet point. Then you can do an 'Ordered list' which uses the tag: "<ol>" and then every item <li> that follows it has numbers in ascending order. -->
        
        <h1>List Practice</h1>    
        <p>This is a way to practice lists, both ordered and unordered. Because I'm silly and want to do it even though there really isn't a whole lot to experiment with, it's a good thing to practice. We'll start with an unordered list of animals.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dogs</li>
            <li>Cats</li>
            <li>Eagles</li>
            <li>Foxes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Now, in order of <strong><em>importance</em></strong>, using an ordered list.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Dogs</li>
            <li>Cats</li>
            <li>Foxes</li>
            <li>Eagles</li>
        </ol>
